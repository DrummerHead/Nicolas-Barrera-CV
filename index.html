    <aside>
      <p>All of the above are keywords. Standardized keywords that are useful for you to quickly grasp what is that I do. But where does Usability stop and User Experience begin? Where does wireframing stop and Information Architecture begin? For me, there is no clear line. It is the amalgamation of all of this knowledge what&#8217;s necessary for the development of the proper product.<p>
      <p>My ultimate goal is to align the objectives of the product with the needs of the users. The best tools for this is good criterion, intuition and the flexibility to adapt to any new scenarios or tools necessary.<p>

    <h2><a href='#work-examples' rel='section'>Work Examples</a></h2>
    <p>Vamp fox held quartz duck just by wing. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. The five boxing wizards jump quickly. Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz. My jocks box, get hard, unzip, quiver, flow. Kvetching, flummoxed by job, W. zaps Iraq. My ex pub quiz crowd gave joyful thanks. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. A very bad quack might jinx zippy fowls.</p>
    <p>Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Jumpy halfling dwarves pick quartz box. Vex quest wizard, judge my backflop hand. The jay, pig, fox, zebra and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump. Sex prof gives back no quiz with mild joy. The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.</p>

    <aside>
      <p>Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz. &#8220;Who am taking the ebonics quiz?&#8221;, the prof jovially axed. Why shouldn&#8217;t a quixotic Kazakh vampire jog barefoot? Grumpy wizards make a toxic brew for the jovial queen Sixty zips were quickly picked from the woven jute bag. Big July earthquakes confound zany experimental vow. Foxy parsons quiz and cajole the lovably dim wiki-girl. Cute, kind, jovial, foxy physique, amazing beauty? Wowser! Have a pick: twenty six letters — no forcing a jumbled quiz! A very big box sailed up then whizzed quickly from Japan. Jack quietly moved up front and seized the big ball of wax. Few black taxis drive up major roads on quiet hazy nights.</p>
      <p>Just poets wax boldly as kings and queens march over fuzz. Bored? Craving a pub quiz fix? Why, just come to the Royal Oak! Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack. Crazy Fredericka bought many very exquisite opal jewels. The job of waxing linoleum frequently peeves chintzy kids. Back in June we delivered oxygen equipment of the same size. Just keep examining every low bid quoted for zinc etchings. How razorback-jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts! A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats. All questions asked by five watched experts amaze the judge. The wizard quickly jinxed the gnomes before they vapourized. Every good cow, fox, squirrel, and zebra likes to jump over happy dogs.</p>
